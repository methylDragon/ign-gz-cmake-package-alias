1. Port ign-cmake to gz-cmake (ok maybe not)
2. IgnConfigureBuild won't matter, instead, target: ign_configure_project, ign_create_packages
3. Specifically...
  - IgnConfigureProject.cmake (ign_configure_project)
  - IgnPackaging.cmake (_ign_create_cmake_package) (basically call it twice, toggling between GZ and IGN project names)
  
  

- Add warning in ign_find_package (unfortunately, normal find_package can't be altered..)
- find_package, or ign_find_package, or both???? If it's just ign_find_package, ticktocking is trivial, we can just do a string replace
  - Otherwise... We need to generate two sets of config.cmake files for the aliased project...
- CPack?!?!??! Debian namespacing, I have no clue at that point

Also:
- find_package() can be used optionally to find and resolve packages
  - So, for spoofing ign_find_package:
    1. If the package starts with ign, throw a warning to user
    2. Replace ign/ignition with gz and try to find the package with gz
    3. If not found, go back to ign/ignition and find package "normally"
